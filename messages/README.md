messages 
1. All elements work correctly. I originally wanted to use a for/in or a for loop to print the elements of the array into the messages to be more concise, but it did not work with using the .innerHTML tag. 
2. I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment. 
3. I spent approximately 6 hours on this assignment.
