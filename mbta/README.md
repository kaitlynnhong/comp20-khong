MBTA Lab 10
1. All aspects work correctly, no errors in javascript console. but the upcoming train infowindow only shows the next upcoming train in the json, not ALL upcoming trains. Also, I attempted to display the current train markers (commented out), but an error kept popping up saying "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'Lat' of undefined at XMLHttpRequest.request2.onreadystatechange" and I did not have time to fix this before the due date. 
2. I did not work on this assignment with anyone. 
3. I spent approximately 35 hours on this assignment.
