MBTA Lab 8
1. All elements of lab seem to work correctly, but when I added the new Google API key the console gave me an "Uncaught" error message stating that 'initMap is not a function'. thought i directly followed the instructions of pasting my API key into the link provided on Piazza. 
I was also wondering about implementing an easier way to render the polylines without having to type every coordinate out. I was thinking of using a for loop as I did for placing the markers, but found it too confusing. Also, I placed the orange and blue lines, but did not have enough time to do the commuter rail.
2. I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.
3. I spent approximately 11 hours on this assignment.
