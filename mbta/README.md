MBTA Lab 8
1. All elements of the lab work correctly, although I was wondering about implementing an easier way to render the polylines without having to type every coordinate out. I was thinking of using a for loop as I did for placing the markers, but found it too confusing. 
2. I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.
3. I spent approximately 10 hours on this assignment.
