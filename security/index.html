  <h1>Lab 13 Report</h1>
  <p>Introduction:</p>
  <p>I was hired as a security consultant to document the security and privacy issues in this app.<br>
      The app takes in data (latitude, longitude, and login information) from the user and stores it in a mongodb collection.<br>
      The app's url/checkins.json page displays the logged in user's location (lat and lng) pulled from the mongo database.<br> 
      The app's homepage url/ displays which users have checked in (entered the login info) and how many times they have done so.</p>

  <p>Methodology:</p>
  <p>I tested the application for vulnerabilities by modifying the query string in the url (using [$ne]),<br>
  and by inserting javascript alert scripts throughout the code and in the url (javascript:alert('XXS'), <script>alert('XXS')</script>).<br>
  I also ran the code locally on my computer during testing by creating a the server-vuln.js and package.json files on my local device.
